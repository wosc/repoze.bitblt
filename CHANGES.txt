0.9+crop.and.inputvalidation (released 2015-09-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Don't error trying to process .ico files. Just return the original
  data.

- Don't error on HEAD requests as the response has an empty body. Also
  remove the Content-Length header as we cannot calculate the right
  value without knowing the image.

- Use Pillow instead of PIL which is unmaintained for years now.

- Allow cropping image to a specified width and height.

- Normalize sizes <=0 to 1 to prevent spurious errors.

0.9 (released 2012-10-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Maintain embedded ICC Profiles in images. Requires PIL 1.1.7 or later.

- Add simplistic cache implementation. [damien]

- Remove paragraph in readme which mentions the try_xhtml option. It's now a
  no-op. [jinty]

- Use PATH_INFO directly to avoid blowing up on non UTF-8 paths.

0.8 (released 2010-03-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The major change in the 0.8 release was a rewrite of the <img> tag search and
replace to use regexs rather than lxml. It was proving too hard to prevent lxml
from mangling low quality HTML in nasty ways. The new regex based
search/replace takes a lot of care to only modify what is necessary.

Side effects of this change are a reduction of dependencies and theoretically
better performance.

- Work with unclosed <img> tags (HTML4). [jinty]

- Re-write rewrite_image_tags to use regular expressions to find/mangle img
  tags. As well aas removing the dependency on lxml this  prevents a whole
  class of bugs where lxml was changing the HTML source too much, see
  http://bugs.repoze.org/issue103. Backwards compatibility for the
  'ImageTransformationMiddleware' class was preserved by leaving the try_xhtml
  argument in place. It is now a no-op.
  [jinty]

- Make sure resizing preserves GIF transparency.

  [jinty]

- Fix bug where <![CDATA[ escaped sections would be quoted and the CDATA
  stripped. This causes foulups when quoting Javascript.
  [jinty]

- Properly rewrite <img> tags with pixel (e.g. height="100px") attributes,
  previously the url generated missed the regex resulting in broken images.
  [jinty]

- Don't rewrite <img> tags with percentage sizes, only the browser knows
  how big the images should be. See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.6.
  [jinty]

- Use ``unicode_body`` all over to ensure correct
  encoding. [jinty]

- Fixed bug where the leading slash of an absolute URL without the
  FQDN would be wrongly removed. [damien]

- Fixed bug where the quality-parameter would not be coerced to
  integer, required by PIL. [damien]

- Compatibility with Python 2.4. [malthe]

0.7 (released 2009-03-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Don't use python 2.6 syntax.
  [seletz]

- Handle empty content bodies, which can occure for redirects.
  [fschulze]

- Added support for xhtml, which allows the inclusion of namespace tags.
  [fschulze]

- Added option to limit the url rewriting to urls below the application url.
  [fschulze]

- Added scaling filter support.
  [fschulze]

- Support image tags with only one of the width or height attributes set.
  [fschulze]

- Fix UnboundLocalError for respones with untransformed image.
  [fschulze]

- Fix importing of PIL. The old way assumed the broken egg installation.
  [fschulze]

- Made tests run.
  [fschulze]

0.6 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Require to pass in a ``secret`` parameter to configure middleware
  security. [malthe]

0.5 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rewritten URLs are now signed by the middleware to ensure that
  bitblt requests are only crafted by the middleware. This is required
  to shield against DoS attacks. [malthe]

0.4 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed path handling. [malthe]

- Added HTML document processing which scans document for image tags
  and rewrite image ``src`` attribute to include "bitblt" traversing
  directive. This makes it work as an actual middleware, since the
  application semantics are then unchanged. [malthe]

- No longer accept query parameters, but instead require traversing
  directive "/bitblt-<width>x<height>". [malthe]

- Removed functionality to MIME-type convert. [malthe]

0.3 (released 2008-10-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made logic robust to unexpected parameters. [malthe]

- Fixed bug where parameters would be drawn from the WSGI environment. [malthe]

- Added mimetype conversion. [malthe]

0.2 (released 2008-10-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed entry point name.

0.1 (released 2008-10-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial release.
